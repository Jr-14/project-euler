# Multiples of 3 or 5

## Problem Description
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.


## Naive Solution
My naive solution to the problem involves iterating from 1 to 1000 (exclusive) and for each iteration, checking whether
the number modulo 3 or 5 is 0. Thus if the modulo is zero then add it to the sum. This naive solution is O(n) as if we
were to count the n > 5 > 3, then we'd have to iterate up to n to count the sum.

## Efficient Solution
TBD
